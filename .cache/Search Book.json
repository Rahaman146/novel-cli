Created by English Catholic scholars in exile during the Reformation, this translation rendered the Latin Vulgate into Early Modern English as a Counter-Reformation effort. The New Testament appeared in Rheims in 1582, while the Old Testament followed in Douai nearly three decades later. Later revised by Bishop Richard Challoner in the mid-1700s, this translation influenced the King James Version and remains significant for traditional English-speaking Catholics today.

Created by scholars at the English College in Douai as a Counter-Reformation effort, this work translates the Latin Vulgate into Early Modern English. The New Testament appeared in Rheims in 1582, while the Old Testament followed in two volumes decades later. Extensively annotated and later revised by Bishop Richard Challoner in the 1740s-1750s, it remains influential among traditional English-speaking Catholics, offering a distinctive Catholic perspective on scripture during a turbulent period of religious reform.
